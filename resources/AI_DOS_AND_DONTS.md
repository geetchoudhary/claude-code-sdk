## Rules
1. **NEVER create files** unless explicitly asked
2. **Read before edit** - understand existing patterns first
3. **Copy existing patterns** - don't invent new ones
4. **Verify dependencies exist** before using them

## Before Writing Code
- Find 2-3 similar examples in codebase
- Copy their exact structure
- Match their naming/style/imports

## Common Failures
1. Guessing imports → Check actual files
2. Creating abstractions → Keep it simple
3. Missing error handling → Every async needs try/catch
4. Assuming libraries → Check package.json first

## Done When
- No errors
- Matches existing patterns
- Actually works
